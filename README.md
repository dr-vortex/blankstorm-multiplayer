# Annihilation Multiplayer

This is a repository made for the development and testing of multiplayer for [Annihilation](https://annihilation.drvortex.dev).

## Testing

You can test the app [here](https://a.drvortex.dev/mp). You will have to connect before you send a ping or packet. Ping the server to see the amount of clients and the server status (always `online`). Some packets you can send:
- get-clients: get the other connected clients.
- get-log: get the server logs. Server ops only!
- chat: sends a chat message. All other clients will recieve this!

At some point some of the server code may not be posted to this repo if it includes sensitive data (like database passwords).
