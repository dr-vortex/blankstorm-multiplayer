# Annihilation Multiplayer

This is a repository made for the development and testing of multiplayer for [Annihilation](https://annihilation.drvortex.dev).

## Testing

You can test the app [here](https://a.drvortex.dev/mp). You will have to log in before you can connect. Ping the server to see some server info.

After connecting, simply enter a chat message and press enter or click send to send it. You can also send a raw packet using the format `>type:content`.

Multiplayer testing is available in Infdev 8+ by adding the mp query parameter to the url. For example: [https://a.drvortex.dev/play?mp=true](https://a.drvortex.dev/play?mp=true)
